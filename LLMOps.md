# LLMOps

LLMOps (Large Language Model Operations) refers to the specialized practices and tools used to develop, deploy, and maintain large language models throughout their lifecycle. It encompasses tasks like data preparation, model fine-tuning, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring, with a focus on addressing the unique challenges posed by the scale and complexity of LLMs compared to traditional machine learning models.
