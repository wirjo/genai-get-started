## Generative AI Security

### Open Source Tools

* [aws-samples/realtime-toxicity-detection](https://github.com/aws-samples/realtime-toxicity-detection) - Detect toxicity across voice and text chats, cost efficiently and at scale, in near real time.
* [protectai/rebuff](https://github.com/protectai/rebuff) - Rebuff is designed to protect AI applications from prompt injection (PI) attacks through a multi-layered defense.
* [NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails) - Open-source toolkit for easily adding programmable guardrails to LLM-based conversational systems. 

### General Guidance

* [Common techniques to detect PHI and PII Data using AWS Services](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/common-techniques-to-detect-phi-and-pii-data-using-aws-services/) - Identifying sensitive data such as protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) and taking appropriate action to safeguard it.

## Using LangChain

* [langchain-aws-template](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-aws-template) -
This package contains code templates to deploy LLM applications built with LangChain to AWS. The templates contain both the infrastructure (CDK code) and the application code to run these services.
